# E-commerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Persona-Building-Excel_Project
This Excel project analyzes an e-commerce customer churn dataset to understand why customers leave or stay. Using data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations, the project builds churned and loyal customer personas across behavior, engagement, value, and categorical dimensions to derive practical, business-focused insights.





# Behavior Persona – What This Analysis Is About

The **Behavior Persona** focuses on how customers actually use the platform, not who they are.
Instead of looking at age or location, this analysis answers one simple question:

**“How do churned customers behave differently from loyal customers on this platform?”**

To understand this, I analyzed six behavioral metrics using pivot tables, comparing Churned vs Loyal customers based on their average behavior.

These six columns help explain:

How often do customers engage

How deeply they interact

How recently and frequently they purchase

Whether spending alone guarantees loyalty

## Why These 6 Behavioral Columns Matter

Each column represents a different part of customer behavior:

1. Login Frequency – habit and consistency

2. Session Duration Average – time spent per visit

3. Pages Per Session – depth of exploration

4. Days Since Last Purchase – recent engagement

5. Total Purchases – long-term commitment

6. Average Order Value – spending intensity

Together, they create a complete picture of customer engagement.

Pivot-Based Interpretation 
### 1️. How does login frequency differ between churned and loyal users?

On this platform:

Churned users log in around 9.12 times
Loyal users log in around 12.64 times

Interpretation:
Churned customers interact with the platform less frequently. This suggests weaker habit formation. Customers who log in more often are more likely to stay engaged and remain loyal.

Business insight:
Increasing login frequency through reminders, personalized notifications, or **content updates** may help reduce churn risk.

### 2️. Do churned users spend less time per session?

The data shows:

Churned users have an average session duration of around 23.69 minutes
Loyal users spend noticeably longer per session

Interpretation:
Churned users tend to leave sooner, which may indicate lower interest, poor content relevance, or friction in the user experience.

Business insight:
Improving onboarding, **content quality**, or in-session engagement could encourage users to stay longer.

### 3️. Do churned users explore fewer pages?

Interpretation:
Churned users view fewer pages per session compared to loyal users. This shallow browsing behavior suggests they are not fully exploring the platform or finding enough value.

Business insight:
Better navigation, recommendations, or guided journeys could help users discover more content and stay engaged.

### 4️. How important is recency of purchase?

Interpretation:
Churned customers typically have more days since their last purchase, while loyal customers purchase more recently.

This is one of the strongest churn signals.

Business insight:
Customers who haven’t purchased in a long time may need reactivation campaigns, discounts, or reminders.

### 5️. Does total purchase history matter?

Interpretation:
Churned users generally have fewer total purchases over their lifetime, while loyal users show repeat buying behavior.

Business insight:
Early repeat purchases are critical. Encouraging a second or third purchase early can significantly improve retention.

### 6️. Does higher spending guarantee loyalty?

Interpretation:
Average Order Value alone does not guarantee loyalty. Some churned customers may place high-value orders but still disengage afterward.

Key insight:
Spending high once is not the same as staying engaged.

Business insight:
Retention strategies should focus on engagement and frequency, not just high transaction value.

## Churn Behavior Persona 

Churn-Prone Customer Persona

Logs in infrequently (around the churned average)
Spends less time per session
Explores fewer pages
Has not purchased recently
Has made fewer total purchases
May still place high-value orders, but lacks repeat engagement


**This customer visits occasionally, completes short sessions, and does not build a strong habit around the platform. Even if they spend well once, they fail to return consistently and eventually disengage.**

## Loyal Behavior Persona 

Loyal Customer Persona:

Logs in frequently
Stays longer during each session
Explores more pages
Purchases recently and repeatedly
Builds a strong purchase history
Shows consistent engagement over time


**This customer treats the platform as a regular destination. Frequent visits, deeper exploration, and repeated purchases indicate strong engagement and long-term loyalty.**



# Value Persona – What This Analysis Is About

The Value Persona represents customers based on the economic value they bring to the business, helping to identify which users generate more revenue. It focuses on metrics like Lifetime Value, Average Order Value, and Total Purchases.

The Value Persona complements the overall buyer persona by showing the financial impact of each customer segment. It works alongside behavior and engagement personas to give a complete picture of who the customers are, how they act, how they engage, and how valuable they are to the business.

## Churned Customers:

Average Lifetime Value: $1,425.42 — Customers around this lifetime value may still churn. The company should actively retain them, even if they appear valuable.

Average Order Value: $134.76 — Indicates these users make higher-value purchases per order, but since their total purchases are fewer, they could still leave. Retention strategies should focus here as well.

Total Purchases: 11.35 — Lower purchase frequency signals a risk of churn despite high order value. Focus should be on encouraging more frequent purchases.

## Loyal Customers:

Average Lifetime Value: $1,446.81 — Slightly higher, showing these users generate steady revenue over time. Users surpassing the churned average are more likely to remain loyal.

Average Order Value: $118.38 — Lower per order than churned users, but consistent purchasing makes them valuable over time.

Total Purchases: 13.83 — Higher frequency reinforces loyalty and steady revenue contribution.

## Actionable Insight:

Users with lifetime value near $1,425.42, order value ~$134, and total purchases ~11 are at risk of churning.

Users above these thresholds are likely loyal.

The company should design retention strategies targeting those just below the loyalty thresholds, and continue nurturing consistent, frequent buyers.

Churned users often make higher-value orders but purchase less frequently, putting them at risk despite contributing decent revenue. Loyal users may spend less per order but buy consistently, generating steady lifetime value. Focusing retention strategies on users near the churn thresholds can help convert at-risk customers into long-term loyal ones.
